# Simple-DNA-Sequences

(1) Determine the complement of the original DNA sequence read in, and print
both the original and the complement in a parallel output format, for ease
of comparison.

(2) Create 5 random simulated simple mutations in the DNA sequence.
That is, in 5 positions your program selects pseudo-randomly, insert an "M"
into the position to replace the A, T, G or C that was previously there.
Then print both the original and the mutated sequence in parallel output
format, again, for ease of comparison.

(3) Allow the user to enter a substring that he or she wants to search for in
the original DNA sequence.  For example, the user might search for a sequence
such as "AGTCA" and find out where this sequence is located.  In this program,
you only need to find the first instance of such a substring, and report at
what index it was located at. If the substring is not found, you must report
that.

(4) Quit the program.
